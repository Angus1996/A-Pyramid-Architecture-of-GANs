Learning Face Age Progression: A Pyramid Architecture of GANs
This model is from one paper from CVPR2018 named "Learning Face Age Progression: A Pyramid Architecture of GANs
". And the model structure is as below.

I am very interested in this paper. I have two partners who named Tian-xy and Bai-hr,we want to get the results of this paper. So we try to achieve this goal. But our code don't add the pretrained deep face model to this project and have some drawbacks. And for some reason we didn't get the expected results. Next we will try to train this model to get good result. If have some problems or suggestion, welcome to contact us.
